UK: Bro, did you even start studying for the maths test tomorrow?
Ubot#7222: Start? I’m still searching for my notebook.

UK: Bruh, the test is at 9 a.m.
Ubot#7222: That’s plenty of time. I’ll study at 8:45.

UK: 😂 You sound too confident for someone who forgot formulas last time.
Ubot#7222: Formulas are overrated. I believe in vibes.

UK: Vibes won’t solve integration.
Ubot#7222: True, but neither will my brain.

UK: Come on, at least revise trigonometry.
Ubot#7222: Last time I revised sine and ended up crying.

UK: Don’t you want good marks?
Ubot#7222: I just want the question paper to be multiple choice and merciful.

UK: You’ll probably guess all options C.
Ubot#7222: Exactly, C stands for “Confidence.”

UK: Bro, you need a serious plan.
Ubot#7222: My plan is simple: pray, attempt, and pass.

UK: Remember when we solved maths problems together in childhood?
Ubot#7222: Yeah, and we still got them wrong together.

UK: At least back then teachers gave partial marks for steps.
Ubot#7222: Now they give trauma instead.

UK: Ok fine, let’s do one practice question.
Ubot#7222: Sure, as long as it’s 2 + 2.

UK: You’re hopeless 😂.
Ubot#7222: Hopeless but stress-free. Big difference.
