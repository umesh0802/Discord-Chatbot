# 🤖 Discord Chatbot with OpenAI

A **Discord chatbot** built with **Python, OpenAI API, and discord.py**, deployed using **Replit**.  
The bot listens to messages in a Discord server, keeps track of chat history, and generates AI-powered responses.

Ps: I don't have OpenAI Subscription, soon I'll upload new bot made with Google Gemini API. (Thank You 🤗)

## ✨ Features
- Uses **OpenAI GPT models** to generate human-like replies
- Stores and loads conversation history from text files (`chatA.txt`, `chatB.txt`)
- Responds only when mentioned in the server
- Simple design, easy to extend for custom use cases
